# Colombian Accidents Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing data on accidents and personal injuries in Colombia, as well as some visualizations created using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your computer, along with the following libraries:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:

Once you have installed the necessary libraries, you can open the Jupyter Notebook colombian_acc.ipynb to begin exploring the data and running the analysis.

## Data Source

The data used in this analysis was obtained from the DatosColombia.com and Policia Nacional and includes information on accidents and personal injuries that occurred in Colombia from 2010 to 2021.

## Visualizations

The following visualizations are included in this repository:

- Histogram of the number of accidents by department
- Line chart of the accident over the time
- Histogram and bar charts of the gender of the victims
- Bar chart of the percentage of accidents by department
- 3D scatter plot of the clustered data

## Power BI Dashboard

A Power BI dashboard has also been created to visualize the data in a more interactive and user-friendly way. You can view the dashboard by clicking on this https://onx.la/71e87.
