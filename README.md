# Data Analysis Project for Colombia Accidents

This data analysis project will analyze and identify the main factors associated with accidents in Colombia. The project will look into factors such as hour, municipality, department, person's behavior, and the objects involved in the accident. The goal of the project is to gain insight into the most common causes of accidents in Colombia, so that action can be taken to reduce the number of accidents in the future.

The data for this project will be collected from official sources such as the Colombian Police and from public databases. The collected data will then be analyzed using a variety of statistical methods and machine learning algorithms. The results of the analysis will be used to identify the main factors associated with accidents in Colombia, and to make recommendations on how to reduce the number of accidents.

The project will be open source and available for anyone to contribute to. Contributions may include data analysis, feature engineering, and recommendation of best practices for accident prevention. All contributors will be credited in the project's README file.
