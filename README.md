# colombian_accidents_data_analysis
Colombian accident cases

The goal of this project is to analyze accident data to identify patterns and trends that will enable government agencies to take action to reduce accident rates in the country.
I am using data analysis tools such as the Python programming language and software such as Power BI to analyze accident data. 
I am investigating factors that contribute to accidents, such as behavior, timing, location, and vehicle type.
I am using statistical techniques to extract insights and suggest improvements to reduce the number of accidents in Colombia.
